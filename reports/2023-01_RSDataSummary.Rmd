# Purpose

This document walks through some of the remote sensing satellite options for use in creating a rasterized timeseries of presence/absence of sediment plumes and blooms. Note that this summary is limited to the Landsat constellation, MODIS/VIIRS, and HLS (Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel) as they provide 3 spatial and temporal options for raster development.

# Time and Scale

There is an inherent trade off between satellite image overpass frequency and the resolution (pixel size) of the satellite sensors.

: Table 1. Satellite background information. ^a^ LS7 is currently in the process of being decommissioned. While we are still seeing LS7 images through 2022, they have started to become unreliable due to the proximity of the satellite to the earth. ^b^ Data are resampled to a 30x30m pixel, even if the resolution is larger. ^c^ There are two sensor groups on the VIIRS satellite with differing resolutions. ^d^ Data become more sparse in January 2021 - NASA is not processing all available tiles, but can upon request.

## Satellite Image Tiles

Satellite images are processed as tiles, and each of the satellite constellations use a different grid system.
