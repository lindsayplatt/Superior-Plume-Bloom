# eePlumB

The purpose of this directory and the associated workflow is to label Plumes and Blooms from satellite imagery in freshwater lakes. We use the methodology and workflow established in the [Global Rivers Obstruction Database](https://github.com/GlobalHydrologyLab/GROD) (GROD) to create a training dataset of labeled pixels for image segmentation of Lake Superior's western basin as an example use case.

## Future plans

The GROD workflow will be adapted to using all available scenes instead of the most recent cloud-free scene.
