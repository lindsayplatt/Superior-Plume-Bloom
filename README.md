# HLS stack pulls

These scripts facilitate the access, download, and processing of HLS (Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel) images from NASA'S LP DAAC (Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center). The access and filtering workflow is modeled after the tutorials presented in the `HLS_Tutorial_R` and `CMR STAC API` [resources provided by the LP DAAC](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/LPDUR).
